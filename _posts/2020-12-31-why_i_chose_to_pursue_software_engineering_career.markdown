Despite graduating with a degree in Finance & Investments in May 2020, I decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering around November of this year. It was a very difficult decision to make, considering the fact that I dedicated so much time and effort to work in Finance, but I felt like I was going to make this decision to pursue Software Engineering eventually, so I pulled the trigger. 

During my high school years, I was always planning on pursuing a career in tech and going to a college with a great Computer Science program. I chose to attend St. John's University as a freshman with a major in Computer Science, but I changed my major and career path to Finance a year later. The reason I switched to Finance was my fear of not being able to compete with others in the tech industry, I thought you had to at least start coding in high school to be prepared. I wasn't well informed about the industry, so I decided to choose a safe career choice instead. 

.Now that I am not only well informed about the industry, but have seen real life examples of people who didn't start coding at a super young age succeeding in this industry, I have decided to take the plunge and pursue a career I'm truly passionate about. Studying Finance for four years was a great experience, but I am very eager to learn and work in the tech industry.

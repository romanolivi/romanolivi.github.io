After a very challenging month, I have finally completed the JavaScript module and the portfolio project. JavaScript was an absolute nightmare for me to learn, so being able to finish this project and move on to the next and final module is a huge relief for me. I struggled badly in this module and honestly I am still not comfortable with JavaScript, but I definitely see a huge improvement from when I started so I am optimistic I will master this language sooner rather than later. 

Although learning JavaScript has been brutal, I actually enjoyed learning this language the most, and I plan on working on my own JavaScript projects during my free time to get a better hang of the language. I encourage those that are doing this program, and feel completely lost as I did to just stay patient and practice until your comfortable with the concepts your struggling with. I spent several days working on the same concept until it was ingrained in my memory, and I believe this approach helped me tremendously in getting through this module. 

I am now in the final module and close to finishing this program. I'm very excited to learn React, I've heard from many that React is a fun and extremely helpful framework for JavaScript developers. I remember how much fun it was when I was introduced to Rails, and how easy it was to create web applications with it. I'm hoping I can experience the same feeling with React.

After four long days, I have finally wrapped up and finished my Sinatra portfolio project. The Sinatra module was very challenging for me, so I am relieved to be done with it and move on to Rails. Although I struggled big-time on Sinatra, I enjoyed this experience very much. This was my first time learning and working on a framework, so being able to use what I've learned so far in Ruby, and learn how to make a web application out of my code was a very rewarding experience. 

I'm very thankful towards the labs I had prior to the Sinatra project, in particular the Sinatra NYC and Playlister labs. It took me a couple of days to finish just these two labs, but I'm glad I took my time to actually understand what I was doing and why my code was working or not, because it served as the perfect preperation for this project. Unlike with the first project, I felt much more comfortable and prepared this time around thanks to the labs I did previously. 

This module has also helped me learn how to correct my mistakes more efficiently, whether its by running pry, tux, or carefully reading errors on the browser. Before this module, I felt like if my code wasn't working how I wanted it to, I would take way too long to figure out why which would cost me a lot of valuable time momentum. I made it a point to be more proactive in this module and try a mutitude of ways to get my code working. 

Sinatra was tough, but I am very happy with my experience working through this module. I feel motivated and prepared to get started on Rails.

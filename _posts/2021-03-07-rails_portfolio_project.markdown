After a challenging 5-day stretch working on my Rails porfolio project, I am proud to say I am done and ready to move on to JavaScript. Ever since I started in Flatiron, I was very eager to get to the Rails section of the curriculum. I honestly thought Rails was going to be a much easier experience for me than it was, I always heard about how Rails was like 'magic' and hearing that so much made me a bit overconfident. 

The Rails module wasn't too tough for me until I got to Associations and Authentication, completing and understanding labs on these sections, and implenting these strategies in my project were very challenging. I decided to be patient with this project and not try to finish it quickly like I did with the previous two, I really wanted to submit a project that I actually understood fully, and I believe I did that. Getting past this module is a satisfying feeling, and I'm very excting to get started on JavaScript.

After a long and challenging 5 months, I have finally finished my final project and finished the coursework for the Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron. Like all of the projects that came before, this final project was very demanding. At first it was a challenge to get started and find my rhythm, but once I started visualizing what I wanted on my app everything began to flow nicely. Although my project isn't very complex, I'm proud of how it turned out, I believe this is my best looking project in terms of css, and I also added some unique features that I learned through the internet that makes the experience when using my app a little more interesting. 

Now that I have finished the Software Engineering bootcamp, I feel motivated and ready to begin my career as a software engineer. I still feel like I have so much to learn, but I am confident that I have a good base now that I can build off of. Flatiron has been a great experience, I am very thankful for his program and to all the people at Flatiron who have assisted me on my journey.

I've just completed the first project of the Software Engineering program, the CLI Data Gem project. This project was an enormous challenge for me, I was getting used to working on labs and certain assignments the program provided, but I wasn't used to making such an elaborate project from scratch. The fact that we couldn't ask for help from Flatiron coaches was another challenge I had to overcome. There were many moments where I was stuck for hours on certain lines of code I was working on, and was forced to find the solution on my own. 

Although my experience working on this project was pretty rough, I am also appreciative since I was able to push myself intellectually as hard as I did. Working on this project forced me to think creatively, rather than follow instructions and complete assignments exactly how they should be. I was able to find my own unique solutions to the problems I was facing, and having the freedom to carry out the project how I wanted allowed me to learn how to use the all the information I gathered from previous lessons to use. 

This project also gave me the opportunity to work on significant weaknesses I have, such as scraping and object orientation. Since the whole project relied on those two aspects of coding, I had a great opportunity to fix that weakness and turn it into a strength. Although I'm still not fully comfortable with scraping, I'm in a much better place after completing the project than I was before. 

Overall, this project was very tough for me but it was a great experience. I was able to put all of the knowledge I gained during the course to use, and fix some weaknesses I had. I also feel a lot stronger mentally now that I was able to complete the first project, which I always viewed as a big hurdle. I am excited to continue to learn and grow throughout this program.
